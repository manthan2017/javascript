How to Run: 
Run the server (if not already running) by using the “json-server --watch www/html/db.json”. 
Then go to http://proj-319-p11.cs.iastate.edu/index.html while inside the isu campus network.
In case, for any reason, direct web access doesn’t work, unzip the homework .zip archive and run index.html. 
Both ways work.

We have used JS,JQuerry,html and CSS on client-side and json-server(https://github.com/typicode/json-server)  on the server-side.
